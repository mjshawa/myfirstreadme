# Discription
This is a trainning block, involves endless learning curve in understanding github in order to be equiped with experience needed to running and managing repo's and colaborating with other Tech and IT scholars globally. This is basically a training lab for my needed level of expertise.

For now there is no necessary installation steps because it doesen't contain any executable code hence this is for documentation purpose.

# Usage 
This repo is for education purposes.
my README.md file can be viewed directly github to see how markdown is rendered.

# Example of a code snippet
